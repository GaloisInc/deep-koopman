# deep-koopman
Koopman theory is a mathematical technique to achieve data-driven approximations of dynamical systems. This package implements Deep Koopman â€“ a method to achieve Koopman approximations using *machine learning and deep neural networks* to learn the dynamics of any system and predict its unknown states.

We acknowledge the work of [Lusch et al.](https://github.com/BethanyL/DeepKoopman), which our work builds on and expands via the following key features:
- A generalized software tool to apply deep learning based Koopman theory to any system with arbitrary number of input components and amount of input data.
- Extensive options / hyperparameters to customize training and overcome the mathematical challenges of applying deep learning to Koopman theory.
- A ready-to-use hyperparameter search module to improve performance.
- Novel error functions for visualizing performance.
- Built using [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/), supports both CPU and GPU platforms.

## Background
This section gives a brief overview. For a thorough mathematical treatment, refer to [`koopman_theory.pdf`](./koopman_theory.pdf).

Assume a dynamical system $x_{t+1} = F(x_t)$, where $x$ is the (multi-dimensional, i.e. vector) state of the system at index $t$, and $F$ is the evolution rule describing the dynamics of the system. Koopman theory attempts to transform $x$ into a different space $y = g(x)$ where the dynamics are linear, i.e. $y_{t+1} = Ky_t$, where $K$ is the Koopman matrix. Linearizing the system is incredibly powerful since the state $x_t$ at any $t$ can be predicted from $K$ and the initial state $x_0$ as $x_t = g^{-1}\left(K^tg(x_0)\right)$.

The Deep Koopman system in this package performs three tasks:
- *Reconstruction* (`recon`): Learn an autoencoder architecture to create the pipeline $\hat{x} = g^{-1}(y) = g^{-1}\left(g(x)\right)$.
- *Linearity* (`lin`): Learn a Koopman matrix which can operate on the initial encoded state $y_0$ to yield approximations $\{y_1',y_2',\cdots\}$ to the actual values $\{y_1,y_2,\cdots\}$, as well as predict unknown $y_t'$ for values of $t$ not in the given data.
- *Prediction* (`pred`): $\{y_1',y_2',\cdots\}$ are decoded to predict approximations $\{\hat{x}_1',\hat{x}_2',\cdots\}$ to the actual values $\{x_1,x_2,\cdots\}$, as well as predict unknown $\hat{x}_t'$ for values of $t$ not in the given data. This is the task we care about the most.

## Known issues
Some common issues and ways to overcome them are described in the [known issues](https://github.com/GaloisInc/deep-koopman/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Aknown-issue+is%3Aclosed).

### UserWarning: An output with one or more elements was resized
If you get this `UserWarning`, *do not worry*. Even though Pytorch complains, the matrix shapes are actually perfectly compatible.

### Numerical instabilities
The mathematical theory behind Deep Koopman involves operations such as singular value decomposition, eigenvalue decomposition, and matrix inversion. These can lead to the gradients becoming numerically unstable.

Specifically, to debug gradient issues, insert the following line in your script:
```python
torch.autograd.set_detect_anomaly(True)
```
This catches runtime errors such as exploding `NaN` gradients and displays where they happened in the forward pass. The cost is slower execution.
